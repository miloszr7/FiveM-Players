# FiveM Players
Simple web application that allows you to display online players and their details in game.  
Normally If you want to check how many players are online or their list you'll go to the FiveM servers website, and that's fine.
In this web dashboard you have a bit more details such as: In-game ID and ping. Yea that's not a lot, but its always something, right?
